ðŸŒ¿ Project: Plant Disease Classification (Deep Learning + Streamlit)
1. Project Overview

        This project focuses on automated plant disease detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
       It classifies plant leaf images into healthy or diseased categories, helping farmers and researchers detect diseases early and improve crop management.
        The model was trained on a Kaggle dataset of plant leaf images and deployed with Streamlit for real-time usage.

2. Key Features

        ðŸ§  CNN Model: Built a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras for image classification.

        ðŸŒ± Dataset: Used a Kaggle dataset containing thousands of healthy and diseased plant leaf images.

          ðŸ”„ Data Augmentation: Applied transformations like rotation, flipping, and zooming to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

        ðŸ“Š Training & Evaluation: Optimized accuracy using techniques like dropout, batch normalization, and careful tuning of hyperparameters.

          ðŸ’» Interactive Deployment: Integrated with Streamlit, allowing users to upload a leaf image and instantly get disease predictions.

3. Tech Stack

        Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow, Keras

        Programming Language: Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, OpenCV for preprocessing)

        Deployment: Streamlit app for interactive predictions

        Dataset Source: Kaggle Plant Disease Dataset

4. Why This Project Stands Out

        Demonstrates strong understanding of CNNs for image classification.

        Covers end-to-end deep learning workflow: data preprocessing â†’ augmentation â†’ model training â†’ deployment.

        Shows ability to apply computer vision in agriculture, a real-world domain with huge impact.
  
        Streamlit deployment highlights your skill in turning ML models into usable applications.
